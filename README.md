# Would You Rather?

Would you rather play a game, or wash the dishes? You should probably take a break and play. This application is an implementation of the Would You Rather? game. The game's state is managed with Redux (state management). The UI is built with React. Material-UI components are used, although the true Material-UI Style is not followed.

# Getting Started

1. clone (or fork) this repository with the command: `git clone https://github.com/jeffn12/reactnd-project-would-you-rather.git`
2. install application dependencies with the command: `npm install`
3. start the application using the command `npm start`
4. if your browser doesn't open automatically, click on the link in your command prompt to open the application in your browser

A live version is coming soon!

# Dependencies

In order to run this application locally, you must have installed:

1. Node.js
2. Node Package Manager (npm)

# TODO

- [ ] break down some of the larger components into more reusable chunks
- [ ] make the game persist
  - [ ] create a MongoDB collection and migrate data
  - [ ] create a serverless API (vercel?) to interact with MongoDB
- [ ] add tests

# Thanks
